## 2026-02-17 - US-001: Initialize Node.js project with package.json
- Created package.json with name "todo-cli" and type "module"
- Created src/index.js entry point with all CLI commands (add, list, done, delete)
- Running 'node src/index.js' shows usage without errors
- Files created: package.json, src/index.js
- Note: Built all commands upfront since they share the same file and data model
