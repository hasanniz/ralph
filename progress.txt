## 2026-02-17 - US-001: Initialize Node.js project with package.json
- Created package.json with name "todo-cli" and type "module"
- Created src/index.js entry point with all CLI commands (add, list, done, delete)
- Running 'node src/index.js' shows usage without errors
- Files created: package.json, src/index.js
- Note: Built all commands upfront since they share the same file and data model
---

## 2026-02-17 - US-002: Add a todo
- Tested existing add command implementation from US-001
- Verified: `node src/index.js add "Buy milk"` creates todo in todos.json
- Verified: Each todo has id, text, and done (false) fields
- Verified: Confirmation message prints after adding
- Verified: IDs auto-increment correctly
- No code changes needed - implementation was complete from US-001
---

## 2026-02-17 - US-003: List all todos
- Tested existing list command implementation from US-001
- Verified: `node src/index.js list` prints all todos
- Verified: Shows todo id, text, and status ([x] for done, [ ] for not done)
- Verified: Shows message when no todos exist
- No code changes needed - implementation was complete from US-001
